- [ ] Properly seed the random number generator (ie. don't just call `arduboy.initRandomSeed()` in setup)
	- [ ] Consider modifying the seed during gameplay based on user input
- [ ] Evaluate the built in random number generator. Should I keep using it or switch to a custom one that's either faster, or better for my use cases?
