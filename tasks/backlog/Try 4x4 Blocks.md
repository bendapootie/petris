Standard Tetris has a visible grid that's 10 wide and 20 tall.
Because of the Arduboy's 128x64 screen, I'm using 3x3 blocks to fit all 20 rows in the 64 vertical pixels

If 4x4 blocks were used, only 16 blocks would be visible at a time.
- [ ] Experiment with 4x4 blocks and dynamically shifting the visible portion of the grid
	- This may be an excellent way to get larger, more visible blocks, or it may be super jarring and a terrible idea
